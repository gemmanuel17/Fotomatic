# Fotomatic
This is a Codecademy projec from their Full-Stack Engineer career path.

# Project Description
In this project you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. You will be provided specs to help guide you in making adjustments to the broken code. Download the broken code and the specs. You can also see a working version of the final product.

As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS. Chrome DevTools are essential for debugging – they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.

# My Changes

All my changes can be found in the index.html and style.css filess. I will be commenting in each file where I made the changes.
